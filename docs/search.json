While the midwives only tended to the women giving birth, the medical students also spent time in the autopsy rooms examining corpses.\nSemmelweis started to suspect that something on the corpses, spread from the hands of the medical students, caused childbed fever. So in a desperate attempt to stop the high mortality rates, he decreed: Wash your hands!

The medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.\nOne reason for this was that statistics and statistical arguments were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s. Semmelweis only published his data as long tables of raw data, but he didn’t show any graphs nor confidence intervals.

    "title": "R and SAS: A Synergistic Approach for Clinical Programming",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the evolving landscape of clinical programming, the debate between R and SAS continues to spark discussions among statistical programmers. However, instead of viewing these powerful tools as competitors, we should recognize the potential for them to complement each other in clinical research. Here’s why R and SAS should coexist and how statistical programmers can harness the strengths of both to enhance their work.\n1. R and SAS: Strengths and Synergies\n\nSAS: The Industry Standard\nSAS has long been the gold standard in clinical trials and regulatory submissions, with its robust data management capabilities, validated procedures, and a comprehensive suite of statistical tools. Its strong compliance with regulatory requirements makes it indispensable in the pharmaceutical industry.\nR: The Rising Star\nR, with its open-source nature, provides unparalleled flexibility, a vast repository of packages, and cutting-edge statistical techniques. It’s particularly strong in data visualization, machine learning, and complex statistical modeling, making it a favorite among data scientists and statisticians. By combining SAS’s reliability and regulatory acceptance with R’s flexibility and innovation, clinical programmers can deliver more comprehensive and sophisticated analyses.\n\n2. Why Coexistence is Key\n\nRegulatory Compliance with Innovation\nWhile SAS remains critical for regulatory submissions, incorporating R into the workflow allows for more exploratory and innovative analyses. Programmers can develop and test advanced models in R, then translate the final methods into SAS for submission, ensuring both innovation and compliance.\nEfficiency and Versatility\nSAS excels in data manipulation and report generation, while R shines in data exploration and visualization. Using SAS for large-scale data processing and R for detailed exploration allows programmers to optimize their workflow, making the entire process more efficient.\nBroader Skill Set for Programmers\nLearning both SAS and R equips statistical programmers with a versatile skill set that is highly valuable in the industry. Being proficient in both tools allows programmers to select the best tool for the task at hand, leading to better outcomes and greater career flexibility.\n\n3. Best Practices for Integrating R and SAS in Clinical Programming\n\nInteroperability\nSeamlessly integrating R and SAS in your workflow is possible with tools like SASPy (which allows running SAS code in a Python environment) and Rsas7bdat (for reading SAS data sets in R). This interoperability ensures that you can leverage the strengths of both languages without redundant effort.\nValidation and Reproducibility\nFor regulatory submissions, validation is critical. Use SAS for the final steps where strict adherence to regulatory standards is required. However, R can be used in earlier stages for exploratory analysis, with results cross-checked in SAS to ensure consistency and reproducibility.\nContinuous Learning and Adaptation\nAs the landscape of clinical programming evolves, so too should your skills. Regularly update your knowledge of both SAS and R, exploring new packages, procedures, and best practices to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nThe debate between R and SAS isn’t about choosing one over the other, but about integrating both to leverage their unique strengths. By fostering coexistence between R and SAS, statistical programmers can enhance their analytical capabilities, improve efficiency, and stay compliant with regulatory standards. In a field as dynamic and critical as clinical research, embracing the best of both worlds is not just beneficial—it’s essential."

    "title": "Essential Coding Best Practices for Clinical R programmer",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Almost of big pharmaceutical companies and CROs typically have many programmers, data managers and statisticians producing trial analysis and reporting programs. Each of these has their own style in programming. Unfortunately, such a large variety in program styles can lead to problems in the quality, readability, verifiability and maintainability of the program code. Establishing a central standard, or guideline, for good programming practices (GPP) is therefore a necessary first step for large companies.\nR programming is becoming a powerful tool for data analysis, statistical computing, and data visualization for pharma and clinical research industry. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist or just starting your journey in clinical data analytics and programming, adhering to best practices in R is crucial for writing efficient, readable, and maintainable code.\nOnce the project design is ready, it’s the programmers’ job to develop the building blocks. While programming, it’s beneficial to follow certain conventions that increase the worth of the programs. These conventions are categorized into four criteria:\n Readability: Makes your programs easily understandable, increasing the programmer’s efficiency.\n Efficiency: Reduces the usage of resources like memory and CPU processing time, increasing the computer’s efficiency.\nReusability: Makes your programs reusable by separating frequently used logic from code and creating a separate program /user-defined function.\nRobustability: Makes your programs handle a wide variety of scenarios and does not crash. The program should be executable on a wider range of platforms.\nBelow, we explore key best practices to elevate your clinical R coding skills.\n1. Follow a Consistent Naming Convention\n\nVariable and Function Names: Use clear and descriptive names for variables and functions. Adopting a naming convention like snake_case (e.g., data_frame, calculate_mean) or camelCase (e.g., dataFrame, calculateMean) enhances readability. Consistency is key; choose one style and stick with it throughout your project.\nAvoid Abbreviations: While it may be tempting to use short abbreviations, they can lead to confusion. Instead, opt for fully descriptive names that convey the variable or function’s purpose.\n\n2. Write Modular Code\n\nFunction Use: Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions. This modular approach not only simplifies your code but also makes it easier to test and debug. Each function should perform a single task and be named accordingly.\nScript Organization: Organize your scripts by logically grouping related functions and code blocks. Consider separating data loading, processing, and analysis into different scripts or sections within a script.\n\n3. Document Your Code\n\nComments: Use comments to explain the purpose of complex code blocks or functions. While R code can be self-explanatory with good naming conventions, comments provide valuable context, especially for future you or collaborators.\nRoxygen for Documentation: For functions, consider using Roxygen comments to create detailed documentation. Roxygen allows you to generate documentation files directly from your code, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and use your functions.\n\n4. Adopt the Tidyverse Style\n\nTidy Data Principles: Follow the principles of tidy data where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This makes data manipulation and analysis more intuitive and aligns with the powerful functions provided by the tidyverse suite.\nPipe Operator (%&gt;%): Leverage the pipe operator to create clear and readable data transformation pipelines. The pipe operator enables a left-to-right flow of data through functions, reducing the need for nested function calls and making your code easier to follow.\n\n5. Error Handling and Debugging\n\nUse tryCatch for Robust Code: Implement tryCatch to handle errors gracefully. This ensures that your code can handle unexpected inputs or issues without crashing, allowing for better control over error messages and debugging.\nInteractive Debugging: Utilize R’s interactive debugging tools such as browser(), traceback(), and debug(). These tools allow you to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and understand where and why errors occur.\n\n6. Optimize Performance\n\nVectorization: R is optimized for vectorized operations, meaning operations on entire vectors (arrays) are faster than loops. Whenever possible, replace loops with vectorized functions like apply, sapply, or the purrr package functions.\nProfiling and Benchmarking: Use system.time(), Rprof(), or the microbenchmark package to profile and benchmark your code. Identifying bottlenecks helps in optimizing performance-critical sections.\n\n7. Version Control\n\nUse Git: Track changes in your code with version control systems like Git.

    "title": "Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Generative AI in Clinical Programming",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative AI are revolutionizing various industries, including healthcare and clinical research. In clinical programming, where the accuracy, reproducibility, and speed of data analysis are crucial, these technologies can significantly enhance workflows and outcomes. Integrating AI and Generative AI with R programming offers new possibilities for automating complex tasks, improving decision-making, and generating novel insights from clinical data. Here’s how these technologies are being utilized and can be further explored in clinical programming using R.\n1. Enhancing Data Analysis and Interpretation\n\nPredictive Modeling: AI-driven predictive models can be built using R packages such as caret, xgboost, or randomForest. These models help in forecasting patient outcomes, identifying potential adverse events, and personalizing treatment plans based on patient data. Generative AI can also be employed to simulate patient outcomes under different treatment scenarios, aiding in risk-benefit analysis.\nAdvanced Statistical Methods: AI techniques like deep learning, implemented through R packages such as keras and tensorflow, can be used for more complex statistical analyses that traditional methods might not handle well. For instance, these methods can be applied to analyze large, high-dimensional datasets, like genomics or imaging data, leading to more accurate and nuanced interpretations.\n\n2. Automating Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n\nAI-Powered Data Cleaning: Data cleaning is a critical yet time-consuming aspect of clinical programming. AI algorithms can automate much of this process by identifying and correcting data inconsistencies, imputing missing values, and standardizing data formats. Tools like DataRobot or custom R scripts utilizing AI libraries can be integrated into the workflow to streamline data preparation.\nGenerative Data Augmentation: In cases where clinical trial data is scarce, Generative AI models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) can be used to create synthetic datasets that mimic the statistical properties of real-world data. This can be particularly useful for training AI models in clinical settings where real data may be limited or sensitive.\n\n3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Clinical Text Data\n\nAutomating Text Analysis: NLP, a subset of AI, is increasingly being used to analyze unstructured clinical data such as physician notes, medical records, and patient feedback. R packages like tm, text2vec, and spaCy can be used to extract valuable insights from text data, automate the identification of key medical terms, and even flag potential safety concerns.\nClinical Documentation: Generative AI models, such as GPT-based systems, can assist in generating clinical documentation, summarizing patient reports, and even drafting parts of clinical study protocols. This reduces the burden on clinical programmers and allows for faster report generation while maintaining accuracy and consistency.\n\n4. Improving Reproducibility and Compliance\n\nAutomated Reporting: R combined with AI can automate the generation of clinical trial reports. Generative AI can assist in writing sections of these reports, ensuring that they adhere to regulatory standards and reducing the time required for documentation. The use of templates and automated content generation can ensure consistency and compliance with regulatory requirements.\nAI-Driven Validation: AI can be used to validate data entry and processing steps, ensuring that they comply with pre-specified protocols. For instance, machine learning models can be trained to detect anomalies in data that might indicate errors or deviations from the protocol, allowing for early intervention.\n\n5. Clinical Trial Design and Simulation\n\nAI in Trial Design: AI can optimize clinical trial design by predicting the likely outcomes of different trial configurations. This includes patient recruitment strategies, determining the most appropriate endpoints, and selecting optimal dosing regimens. R can be used to build and validate these AI models, making trial design more efficient and cost-effective.\nGenerative AI for Simulation: Generative AI models can simulate clinical trial outcomes under various scenarios, helping researchers understand potential risks and benefits before the trial even begins. This approach can be integrated with R’s powerful simulation capabilities to create more robust trial designs.\n\n6. Enhancing Personalized Medicine\n\nAI for Precision Medicine: In personalized medicine, AI can analyze patient-specific data to tailor treatment plans. Using R, clinicians can build AI models that predict how individual patients will respond to specific treatments based on their genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. These models can help identify the most effective therapies, minimizing trial-and-error approaches in treatment.\nGenerative AI for Biomarker Discovery: Generative models can be used to discover new biomarkers by generating hypotheses and testing them against large datasets. This can accelerate the development of personalized treatment options and improve patient outcomes.\n\n7. Ethical Considerations and Regulatory Compliance\n\nEthical AI: When using AI in clinical programming, it’s crucial to address ethical considerations such as bias, transparency, and data privacy. AI models should be trained and validated on diverse datasets to avoid biases that could lead to unfair treatment recommendations. R’s flexibility allows for the inclusion of fairness checks and bias mitigation strategies during model development.\nRegulatory Alignment: Ensuring that AI applications in clinical programming comply with regulatory standards is vital. Models must be transparent, explainable, and validated in a way that meets FDA or EMA guidelines. Using R, programmers can document their AI workflows and provide detailed audit trails that demonstrate compliance.\n\n8. Challenges and Considerations\n\nData Quality: Ensuring data accuracy and completeness is crucial for AI model performance.\nModel Interpretability: Understanding how AI models arrive at their decisions is essential for regulatory compliance.\nEthical Implications: Addressing privacy, bias, and fairness concerns in AI applications.\nIntegration with Existing Systems: Seamlessly incorporating AI tools into clinical programming workflows.\nValidation and Verification: Rigorous testing to ensure the reliability of AI-generated outputs.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of AI and Generative AI into clinical programming using R offers immense potential to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation in clinical research. As these technologies continue to develop, their role in automating complex tasks, improving decision-making, and personalizing patient care will likely expand, making them indispensable tools in the clinical programmer’s toolkit. However, as with any powerful tool, careful consideration of ethical, regulatory, and practical implications is essential to fully realize their benefits while minimizing risks."

Surveys are given to a carefully selected sample of people with the goal of generalizing the results to a much larger population.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data is a complex survey of tens of thousands of people designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The NHANES data includes many measurements related to overall health, physical activity, diet, psychological health, socioeconomic factors and more.\nDepending on the sampling design, each person has a sampling weight that quantifies how many people in the larger population their data is meant to represent. In this notebook, we’ll apply survey methods that use sampling weights to estimate and model relationships between measurements.\nWe are going to focus on a common health indicator, Body Mass Index (BMI kg/m2), and how it is related to physical activity.

It also contains a sampling weight variable WTMEC2YR.\nSince NHANESraw data spans 4 years (2009–2012) and the sampling weights are based on 2 years of data, we first need to create a weight variable that scales the sample across the full 4 years. We will divide the 2-year weight in half so that in total, the weights sum to the total US population.\nThe NHANES data has oversampled some geographic regions and specific minority groups. By examining the distribution of sampling weights for each race, we can see that Whites are undersampled and have higher weights while oversampled Black, Mexican, Hispanic people have lower weights since each sampled person in these minority groups represents fewer US people.\n\n\nCode\n# Load the ggplot2 package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Use mutate to create a 4-year weight variable and call it WTMEC4YR\nNHANESraw &lt;- NHANESraw %&gt;%\n                mutate(WTMEC4YR = WTMEC2YR / 2) \n\n# Calculate the sum of this weight variable\nNHANESraw %&gt;% summarize(total_WTMEC4YR = sum(WTMEC4YR))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_WTMEC4YR\n           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     304267200.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot the sample weights using boxplots, with Race1 on the x-axis\nggplot(NHANESraw, aes(x=Race1, y=WTMEC4YR))+\ngeom_boxplot()"

However, we also see that smokers have lower BMI in general. Also, looking closely we see the difference in BMI comparing physically active people to non-physically active people is slightly smaller in smokers than in non-smokers.\nPreviously, we used a simple t-test to compare mean BMI in physically active people and non-physically active people. In order to adjust for smoking status, as well as other possible confounders or predictors of BMI, we can use a linear regression model with multiple independent variables.

The interaction between physical activity and smoking has a small p-value, which suggests the association does vary by smoking status. The difference between physically active and non-physically active people is larger in magnitude in the non-smoker population.\nWe should check the model fit and technical assumptions of our regression model. Then, we can conclude that physically active people tend to have lower BMI, as do smokers. Although they have similar effect sizes, we probably wouldn’t want to recommend smoking along with exercise!\nIn order to determine whether physical activity causes lower BMI, we would need to use causal inference methods or a randomized control study. We can adjust for other possible confounders in our regression model to determine if physical activity is still associated with BMI, but we fall short of confirming that physical activity itself can lower one’s BMI.\n\n\nCode\n# Adjust mod1 for other possible confounders\nmod2 &lt;- svyglm(BMI ~ PhysActive*SmokeNow + Race1 + Alcohol12PlusYr + Gender, \n               design = nhanes_adult)\n\n# Tidy the output\ntidy(mod2)\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   term                      estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 (Intercept)                 33.2       0.316   105.    1.75e-33\n 2 PhysActiveYes               -2.11      0.273    -7.75  5.56e- 8\n 3 SmokeNowYes                 -2.23      0.303    -7.34  1.40e- 7\n 4 Race1Hispanic               -1.47      0.420    -3.49  1.88e- 3\n 5 Race1Mexican                -0.191     0.464    -0.412 6.84e- 1\n 6 Race1White                  -2.08      0.320    -6.49  1.04e- 6\n 7 Race1Other                  -3.11      0.620    -5.01  4.09e- 5\n 8 Alcohol12PlusYrYes          -0.855     0.358    -2.39  2.50e- 2\n 9 Gendermale                  -0.256     0.230    -1.11  2.78e- 1\n10 PhysActiveYes:SmokeNowYes    0.737     0.387     1.90  6.92e- 2"
