United Nations life expectancy data\n\nLife expectancy at birth is a measure of the average a living being is expected to live. It takes into account several demographic factors like gender, country, or year of birth.\n\nLife expectancy at birth can vary along time or between countries because of many causes: the evolution of medicine, the degree of development of countries, or the effect of armed conflicts. Life expectancy varies between gender, as well. The data shows that women live longer that men. Why? Several potential factors, including biological reasons and the theory that women tend to be more health conscious.\n\nLet's create some plots to explore the inequalities about life expectancy at birth around the world. We will use a dataset from the United Nations Statistics Division, which is available [here](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=GenderStat&f=inID:37&c=1,2,3,4,5,6&s=crEngName:asc,sgvEngName:asc,timeEngName:desc&v=1).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This sets plot images to a nice size\noptions(repr.plot.width = 6, repr.plot.height = 6)\n\n# Loading packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttachement du package : 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLes objets suivants sont masqués depuis 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLes objets suivants sont masqués depuis 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Loading data\nlife_expectancy <- read.csv(\"UNdata.csv\")\n\n# Taking a look at the first few rows\nhead(life_expectancy)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Country.or.Area Subgroup      Year\n1     Afghanistan   Female 2000-2005\n2     Afghanistan   Female 1995-2000\n3     Afghanistan   Female 1990-1995\n4     Afghanistan   Female 1985-1990\n5     Afghanistan     Male 2000-2005\n6     Afghanistan     Male 1995-2000\n                                                         Source  Unit Value\n1 UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate) Years    42\n2 UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate) Years    42\n3 UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate) Years    42\n4 UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate) Years    41\n5 UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate) Years    42\n6 UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate) Years    42\n  Value.Footnotes\n1              NA\n2              NA\n3              NA\n4              NA\n5              NA\n6              NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2. Life expectancy of men vs. women by country\n\nLet's manipulate the data to make our exploration easier. We will build the dataset for our first plot in which we will represent the average life expectancy of men and women across countries for the last period recorded in our data (2000-2005).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Subsetting and reshaping the life expectancy data\nsubdata <- life_expectancy  %>% \n    filter(Year == \"2000-2005\") %>%\n    select(Country.or.Area, Subgroup, Value) %>%\n    spread(Subgroup, Value)\n\n# Taking a look at the first few rows\nhead(subdata)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Country.or.Area Female Male\n1     Afghanistan     42   42\n2         Albania     79   73\n3         Algeria     72   70\n4          Angola     43   39\n5       Argentina     78   71\n6         Armenia     75   68\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 3. Visualize I\n\nA scatter plot is a useful way to visualize the relationship between two variables. It is a simple plot in which points are arranged on two axes, each of which represents one of those variables.\n\nLet's create a scatter plot using `ggplot2` to represent life expectancy of males (on the x-axis) against females (on the y-axis). We will create a straightforward plot in this task, without many details. We will take care of these kinds of things shortly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plotting male and female life expectancy\nggplot(subdata, aes(x = Male, y = Female)) +\n    geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 4. Reference lines I\n\nA good plot must be easy to understand. There are many tools in `ggplot2` to achieve this goal and we will explore some of them now. Starting from the previous plot, let's set the same limits for both axes as well as place a diagonal line for reference. After doing this, the difference between men and women across countries will be easier to interpret.\n\nAfter completing this task, we will see how most of the points are arranged above the diagonal and how there is a significant dispersion among them. What does this all mean?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Adding an abline and changing the scale of axes of the previous plots\nggplot(subdata, aes(x = Male, y = Female)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = 2) +\n    scale_x_continuous(limits=c(35,85))+\n    scale_y_continuous(limits=c(35,85))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 5. Plot titles and axis labels\n\nA key point to make a plot understandable is placing clear labels on it. Let's add titles, axis labels, and a caption to refer to the source of data. Let's also change the appearance to make it clearer.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Adding labels to previous plot\nggplot(subdata, aes(x=Male, y=Female))+\n  geom_point(colour=\"white\", fill=\"chartreuse3\", shape=21, alpha=.55, size=5)+\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype=2)+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(35,85))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(35,85))+\n  labs(title=\"Life Expectancy at Birth by Country\",\n       subtitle=\"Years.

Highlighting remarkable countries I\n\nNow, we will label some points of our plot with the name of its corresponding country. We want to draw attention to some special countries where the gap in life expectancy between men and women is significantly high. These will be the final touches on this first plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Subseting data to obtain countries of interest\ntop_male <- subdata %>% arrange(Male-Female) %>% head(3)\ntop_female <- subdata %>% arrange(Female-Male) %>% head(3)\n\n# Adding text to the previous plot to label countries of interest\nggplot(subdata, aes(x=Male, y=Female, label=Country.or.Area))+\n  geom_point(colour=\"white\", fill=\"chartreuse3\", shape=21, alpha=.55, size=5)+\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype=2)+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(35,85))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(35,85))+\n  labs(title=\"Life Expectancy at Birth by Country\",\n       subtitle=\"Years.

How has life expectancy by gender evolved?\n\nSince our data contains historical information, let's see now how life expectancy has evolved in recent years. Our second plot will represent the difference between men and women across countries between two periods: 2000-2005 and 1985-1990.\n\nLet's start building a dataset called `subdata2` for our second plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Subsetting, mutating and reshaping the life expectancy data\nsubdata2 <- life_expectancy %>% \n  filter(Year %in% c(\"1985-1990\", \"2000-2005\")) %>% \n  mutate(Sub_Year=paste(Subgroup, Year, sep=\"_\")) %>% \n  mutate(Sub_Year=gsub(\"-\", \"_\", Sub_Year)) %>% \n  select(-Subgroup, -Year) %>%\n  spread(Sub_Year, Value) %>%\n  mutate(\n    diff_Female = Female_2000_2005 - Female_1985_1990,\n    diff_Male = Male_2000_2005 - Male_1985_1990\n  )\n\n# Taking a look at the first few rows\nhead(subdata2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Country.or.Area                                                        Source\n1     Afghanistan UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate)\n2         Albania UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate)\n3         Algeria UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate)\n4          Angola UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate)\n5       Argentina UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate)\n6         Armenia UNPD_World Population Prospects_2006 (International estimate)\n   Unit Value.Footnotes Female_1985_1990 Female_2000_2005 Male_1985_1990\n1 Years              NA               41               42             41\n2 Years              NA               75               79             69\n3 Years              NA               67               72             65\n4 Years              NA               42               43             38\n5 Years              NA               75               78             68\n6 Years              NA               71               75             66\n  Male_2000_2005 diff_Female diff_Male\n1             42           1         1\n2             73           4         4\n3             70           5         5\n4             39           1         1\n5             71           3         3\n6             68           4         2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 8. Visualize II\n\nNow let's create our second plot in which we will represent average life expectancy differences between \"1985-1990\" and \"2000-2005\" for men and women.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Doing a nice first version of the plot with abline, scaling axis and adding labels\nggplot(subdata2, aes(x=diff_Male, y=diff_Female, label=Country.or.Area))+\n  geom_point(colour=\"white\", fill=\"chartreuse3\", shape=21, alpha=.55, size=5)+\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype=2)+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-25, 25)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-25, 25)) +\n  labs(title=\"Life Expectancy at Birth by Country in Years\",\n       subtitle=\"Difference between 1985-1990 and 2000-2005.

Reference lines II\n\nAdding reference lines can make plots easier to understand. We already added a diagonal line to visualize differences between men and women more clearly. Now we will add two more lines to help to identify in which countries people increased or decreased their life expectancy in the period analyzed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Adding an hline and vline to previous plots\nggplot(subdata2, aes(x=diff_Male, y=diff_Female, label=Country.or.Area))+\n  geom_point(colour=\"white\", fill=\"chartreuse3\", shape=21, alpha=.55, size=5)+\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype=2)+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-25,25))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-25,25))+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +\n  labs(title=\"Life Expectancy at Birth by Country\",\n       subtitle=\"Years.
