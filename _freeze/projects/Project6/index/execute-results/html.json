This patient may have sepsis\n\nSepsis is a deadly syndrome where a patient has a severe infection that causes organ failure. The sooner septic patients are treated, the more likely they are to survive, but sepsis can be challenging to recognize. It may be possible to use hospital data to develop machine learning models that could flag patients who are likely to be septic. However, before we develop predictive algorithms, we need a reliable method to determine patients who are septic. One component of sepsis is a severe infection.\n\nIn this project, we will use two weeks of hospital electronic health record (EHR) data to find out which patients had a severe infection according to four criteria. We will look into the data to see if a doctor ordered a blood test to look for bacteria (a blood culture) and gave the patient a series of intervenous antibiotics.\n\nLet's get started!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(data.table)\n\n# Read in the data\nantibioticDT <- fread('antibioticDT.csv')\n\n# Look at the first 30 rows\nhead(antibioticDT, 30)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    patient_id day_given antibiotic_type  route\n         <int>     <int>          <char> <char>\n 1:          1         2   ciprofloxacin     IV\n 2:          1         4   ciprofloxacin     IV\n 3:          1         6   ciprofloxacin     IV\n 4:          1         7     doxycycline     IV\n 5:          1         9     doxycycline     IV\n 6:          1        15      penicillin     IV\n 7:          1        16     doxycycline     IV\n 8:          1        18   ciprofloxacin     IV\n 9:          8         1     doxycycline     PO\n10:          8         2      penicillin     IV\n11:          8         3     doxycycline     IV\n12:          8         6     doxycycline     PO\n13:          8         8      penicillin     PO\n14:          8        12      penicillin     IV\n15:          9         8     doxycycline     IV\n16:          9        12     doxycycline     PO\n17:         12         4     doxycycline     PO\n18:         12         9     doxycycline     IV\n19:         16         1     doxycycline     IV\n20:         16         4     amoxicillin     IV\n21:         19         3     doxycycline     PO\n22:         19         5     amoxicillin     IV\n23:         19         6   ciprofloxacin     IV\n24:         19        10     doxycycline     IV\n25:         19        12      penicillin     IV\n26:         23         1     doxycycline     IV\n27:         23         1      penicillin     IV\n28:         23         3     amoxicillin     IV\n29:         23         3   ciprofloxacin     IV\n30:         23         3     doxycycline     IV\n    patient_id day_given antibiotic_type  route\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2. Which antibiotics are \"new\"?\n\nThese data represent all drugs administered in a hospital over two weeks. Each row represents one time a patient was given an antibiotic. The variables include the patient identification number, the day the drug was administered, the name of the antibiotic, and how it was administered. For example, patient \"8\" received doxycycline by mouth on the first day of their stay.\n\nWe will identify patients with a serious infection using the following criteria.\n\n**Criteria for Suspected Infection**[\\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903154)\n\n1.  The patient receives antibiotics for a sequence of four days, with gaps of one day allowed.\n\n2.  The sequence must start with a new antibiotic, defined as an antibiotic type that was not given in the previous two days.\n\n3.  The sequence must start within two days of a blood culture.\n\n4.  There must be at least one intervenous (I.V.) antibiotic within the +/-2 day window.\n\nLet's start with the second item by finding which rows represent \"new antibiotics\". We will determine if each antibiotic was given to the patient in the prior two days. We'll visualize this task by looking at the data sorted by id, antibiotic type, and day.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sort the data and examine the first 40 rows\nsetorder(x =

Looking at the blood culture data\n\nNow let's look at blood culture data from the same two-week period in this hospital. These data are in `blood_cultureDT.csv`. Let's start by reading it into the workspace and having a look at a few rows.\n\nEach row represents one blood culture and gives the patient's id and the day the blood culture test occurred. For example, patient \"8\" had a blood culture on the second day of their hospitalization and again on the thirteenth day. Notice that some patients from the antibiotic dataset are not in this dataset and vice versa. Some patients are in neither because they received neither antibiotics nor a blood culture.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in blood_cultureDT.csv\nblood_cultureDT <- fread(\"blood_cultureDT.csv\")\n\n# Print the first 30 rows\nblood_cultureDT[1:30]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    patient_id blood_culture_day\n         <int>             <int>\n 1:          1                 3\n 2:          1                13\n 3:          8                 2\n 4:          8                13\n 5:         23                 3\n 6:         39                10\n 7:         45                 4\n 8:         45                 9\n 9:         45                11\n10:         51                 3\n11:         51                 6\n12:         59                 2\n13:         64                 1\n14:         66                 9\n15:         66                10\n16:         69                 2\n17:         69                 6\n18:         69                 7\n19:         69                11\n20:         69                16\n21:         76                 1\n22:         77                 3\n23:         79                 5\n24:         79                11\n25:         79                12\n26:         80                 3\n27:         80                12\n28:         81                 2\n29:        112                 6\n30:        115                 2\n    patient_id blood_culture_day\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 4. Combine the antibiotic data and the blood culture data\n\nTo find which antibiotics were given close to a blood culture test, we need to combine the drug administration data with the blood culture data. We'll keep only patients that are still candidates for infection—only those in both data sets.\n\nA challenge with the data is that some patients had blood cultures on several different days. For each of those days, we will see if there is a sequence of antibiotic days close to them. To accomplish this, in the merge we will match each blood culture to each antibiotic day.\n\nAfter sorting the data following the merge, you will see that each patient's antibiotic sequence repeats for each blood culture day. This repetition allows us to look at each blood culture day and check if it is associated with a qualifying sequence of antibiotics.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Merge antibioticDT with
